The exta features for this assignment are:

	1.A clear button that gets rid of the first number, the operation and the second number which 
	is displayed in the text block.

	2.A square button that squares the last number  in the textBlock(additional math operation)
		for example "5" + "Square" + "7" + "Square" + "="  would produce "49" in the text block

	3.An alert for when a user divides by zero. When a user tries to divide by zero, and alert window 
	will pop up saying "Error, can't divide by zero"

	
	This calculator does math on the last one/two (depending on the operation) number(s).
	It does the last operation clicked before the "=" is clicked as well.
	For example "5" + "+" + "6" + "-" + "2" + "=" will produce "4"
	because 6-2 were the last numbers/operation before the equals button was hit.
